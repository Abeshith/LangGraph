## üîç Document Processing Tips

### For RAG Implementation
1. **Chunking Strategy**: Documents can be split by paragraphs or topics
2. **Metadata Enhancement**: Add document type, topic, and date information
3. **Cross-References**: Many documents reference similar concepts
4. **Entity Extraction**: Extract people, places, dates, and scientific terms

### Preprocessing Recommendations
```python
# Example preprocessing approach
def preprocess_curie_documents(file_path):
    # Load document
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Add metadata based on filename
    metadata = {
        "source": file_path,
        "topic": extract_topic_from_filename(file_path),
        "document_type": "historical_text",
        "subject": "marie_curie",
        "domain": "science_history"
    }
    
    return content, metadata

def extract_topic_from_filename(filename):
    topic_mapping = {
        "1_curie_bio.txt": "biography",
        "2_radiation_discovery.txt": "scientific_discovery",
        "3_radium_application.txt": "applications",
        "4_radioactivity_medical.txt": "medical_applications",
        "5_nobel_prize.txt": "recognition",
        "6_radiotherapy_origin.txt": "medical_development",
        "7_modern_radiation.txt": "modern_applications",
        "8_curie_lab_notes.txt": "laboratory_work",
        "9_impact_on_chemistry.txt": "scientific_impact",
        "10_healthcare_advances.txt": "healthcare_impact"

def load_curie_documents():
    documents = []
    doc_folder = Path("Curie_Radiation_Documents")
    
    for file_path in doc_folder.glob("*.txt"):
        content, metadata = preprocess_curie_documents(file_path)
        documents.append({
            "content": content,
            "metadata": metadata,
            "id": file_path.stem
        })
    
    return documents

# Use with your RAG system
def setup_curie_rag():
    documents = load_curie_documents()
    
    # Create embeddings and vector store
    # (Implementation depends on your RAG framework)
    vectorstore = create_vector_store(documents)
    
    return vectorstore
```

### Sample RAG Workflow
1. **Load Documents** ‚Üí Process all 10 text files
2. **Create Embeddings** ‚Üí Generate vector representations
