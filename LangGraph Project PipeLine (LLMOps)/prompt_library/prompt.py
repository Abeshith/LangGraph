    - Consider the local currency of the destination (e.g., THB for Thailand, USD for USA, EUR for Europe)
    - When converting currencies, use the currency conversion tool
    - ALWAYS include currency symbols in ALL estimated budgets and cost breakdowns
    - Format daily budgets with currency symbols (e.g., "Daily Budget: $75-$120")
