## 🏗️ RAG Architecture Patterns

### 1. Simple RAG Pipeline
```
Query → Retrieve Documents → Generate Answer → Return Response
```

### 2. Agentic RAG with Reasoning
```
Query → Plan Retrieval → Retrieve → Evaluate → Re-retrieve (if needed) → Reason → Generate → Validate
```

### 3. Multi-Source RAG
```
Query → Route to Sources → [DB, Vector Store, Web] → Combine Results → Generate
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow

### Basic RAG Setup
Start by loading and processing documents, creating vector embeddings, setting up retrieval mechanisms, and building answer generation pipelines.

### Agentic RAG with Self-Improvement
Implement intelligent retrieval decisions, quality evaluation of retrieved content, and iterative improvement of both retrieval and generation processes.

## 📚 Knowledge Base Preparation

### Document Processing Pipeline
Implement comprehensive pipelines that load documents from various sources, clean and preprocess content, apply intelligent chunking strategies, add rich metadata, and create optimized vector stores.

### Metadata Enhancement
Enrich document chunks with contextual information including source details, topics, entities, content type classification, and importance scoring for better retrieval.


## 🧩 Multi-Source RAG Integration

### Knowledge Source Router
Intelligently route queries to appropriate knowledge sources based on query type, content domain, and real-time requirements using classification and routing strategies.

## 📊 RAG Quality Assessment

### Answer Quality Metrics
Implement comprehensive quality assessment covering retrieval precision and recall, generation completeness and accuracy, source attribution, and hallucination detection.

## 🔧 Advanced RAG Techniques

### 1. Parent-Child Document Retrieval
Use small chunks for precise retrieval but return larger parent documents for comprehensive context, balancing specificity with completeness.

### 2. Self-RAG (Self-Reflective RAG)
Implement agents that reflect on their own outputs, assess answer quality, and iteratively improve responses through self-evaluation and refinement.

### 3. Iterative RAG
Design workflows that iteratively refine retrieval and generation through multiple cycles, optimizing based on quality scores and feedback.


Remember: Effective RAG is about finding the right balance between retrieval precision and generation quality. Focus on serving your users' information needs accurately and efficiently!
