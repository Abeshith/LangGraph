## üîß Tool Development Patterns

### Basic Tool Structure
Create tools using the `@tool` decorator with proper type annotations and clear descriptions. Handle errors gracefully and return meaningful results.

### Advanced Tool with State Management
Implement stateful tools that maintain connections, track history, and manage resources throughout their lifecycle.

## üöÄ Tool Integration Workflows

### Simple Tool Integration
Use ToolNode and tools_condition for basic tool integration, allowing agents to decide when to use tools and handle the results appropriately.

### Advanced Tool Orchestration
Implement sophisticated tool planning, dependency management, and multi-step execution with conditional routing based on tool execution results.

## üåê External API Integration

### REST API Tool
Create tools that make HTTP requests to external APIs with proper error handling, timeout management, and response formatting.

### Web Scraping Tool
Implement web scraping capabilities with user agent headers, content extraction using CSS selectors, and content length management.

## üìä Specialized Tools

### Data Analysis Tool
Build tools for data analysis that can load various data formats, perform statistical operations, and generate meaningful insights from datasets.

### File Operations Tool
Create secure file system tools with path validation, operation restrictions, and comprehensive error handling for file management tasks.

## üîÑ Tool Error Handling and Recovery

### Robust Tool Execution
Implement resilient tool execution with retry logic, exponential backoff, and jitter to handle temporary failures gracefully.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Use circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures when external services become unavailable. Monitor failure rates and temporarily disable failing tools to protect the overall system.

Remember: Great tools make great agents. Focus on building reliable, efficient, and well-documented tools that solve real problems effectively!
