# LangGraph Learning Repository

Welcome to the LangGraph Learning Repository! This comprehensive collection contains hands-on examples, tutorials, and practical implementations of LangGraph - a powerful library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.

## üöÄ What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It extends LangChain with the ability to coordinate multiple actors in a structured graph format, enabling complex workflows, agent interactions, and stateful conversations.

   .\langgraph-handson\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if available)
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
     LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_key
     ```
